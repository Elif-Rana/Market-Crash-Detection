# Market-Crash-Detection

This project was developed with the primary objective of detecting significant market crashes by analyzing financial time series data. Since there is no universally accepted definition of a market crash, two different approaches were adopted to define what constitutes a crash, allowing for a more flexible and comprehensive analysis. 

The motivation behind the project stems from the critical need for early warning systems in financial markets, which can assist investors and institutions in managing risks and making timely decisions. The detection pipeline combines statistical techniques and machine learning models to uncover patterns and anomalies that may signal an upcoming crash. These methods include both traditional tools such as standard deviation thresholds and boxplot-based anomaly detection, as well as advanced machine learning techniques like Isolation Forest, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
